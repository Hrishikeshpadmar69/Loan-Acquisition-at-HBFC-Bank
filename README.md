# Loan-Acquisition-At-HBFC-Bank
HBFC Bank aims to increase its personal loan portfolio by targeting potential customers who already hold savings accounts with the bank. The objective is to understand the characteristics and behaviours of customers who have taken personal loans compared to those who haven't, enabling the bank to effectively target and market to potential loan customers.
